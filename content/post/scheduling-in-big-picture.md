Real-Time Scheduling Theory has been developed over the last 40 years, since the first published work of Liu and Layland in 1973. Before that, real-times systems were designed with cyclic executives, which is in a ad-hoc manner and very difficult to maintain. In general, the theory is consist of task modelling, scheduling policy and schedulability test. Some other issues, e.g., resource management, response time analysis, worst-case execution time analysis, are also involved in the design of real-time systems. 
The following is a big picture of the real-time systems that I spent a month of research, which basically includes every aspects of real-time systems.

The exact purpose of this blog is to fully explore these topics and explain to public my understanding of past and future research of real-time systems. The topics covered include theory as well as design of real-time systems.
